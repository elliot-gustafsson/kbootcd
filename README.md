# kbootcd

The Kubernetes Bootc Daemon is a node-level agent that automates OS image updates for Kubernetes nodes using `bootc`.

## Operation

The daemon runs a reconciliation loop that continuously aligns the node's OS image with a desired target by performing the following steps:

1. **Read Desired State:** It reads the target OS image digest or reference from a local file, which is typically mounted via a Kubernetes ConfigMap.
2. **Evaluate Current State:** It queries the host using `bootc status` to determine the currently booted and staged image layers.
3. **Stage Update:** If the desired image differs from the booted image and is not yet staged, the agent executes `bootc switch` to stage the new OS image layer on the host.
4. **Maintenance Window Validation:** If an update is staged and requires a reboot, the daemon waits for the host time to enter the configured maintenance window.
5. **Cluster Coordination:** To prevent simultaneous node restarts, it attempts to acquire a distributed lock via a Kubernetes `Lease` object in the cluster.
6. **Health Check:** It verifies that all other nodes in the cluster are in a `Ready` state before proceeding with node disruption.
7. **Drain and Reboot:** After acquiring the lock and confirming cluster health, it safely cordons the node, evicts running workloads, and issues a host reboot.
8. **Restore:** After the node reboots with the updated OS image, it automatically uncordons the node to resume scheduling and releases the distributed lock.

## Environment Variables

- `NODE_NAME`: The name of the Kubernetes node the daemon is running on. Must be set to identify the node for API operations and the node drain process.
